	<h1>Who I am?</h1>
	<p>My name is Gleb Rusyaev. I am doing some stuff in computer science, reverse engineering and mathematics.</p>
	<h2>History of this site</h2>
	<p>First of all it's my personal blog, but actually this site is an interesting project.
		It is absolutly free and light-weight, including domain, host (<i>pages</i>) and mail smtp/imap retranslator (<i>ImprovMX</i>)

			<h3>Salieri: Pseudo-Homomorphic Computation Module</h3>
			<p>The concept, protocol and definition of the new "pseudo-homomorphic" processor achitecture for trusted cloud computing, anti-tampering and computer science. Using the modern hardware anti-tampering technologies (which are pretty succesfull) and asymmetric crypto-algorithms, I developed the first open-source (GNU GPL v3) specialization of pseudo-homomorphic processor. And using the concept of "oracles", PHCM can also solve various computer science problems in practice ("Secure Multi-Party Computation" used as an example in this article). <a href="https://github.com/rusyaew/PHCM_Salieri">Article(RU)</a>

			<h3>LGCA: Lossless Geometrical Compression Algorithm</h3>
			<p>Integer can be compressed by finding closest perfect power, then writing power and the absolute value of difference between them. Approximate compression rate (on random numbers) from 4 % to 21 %</p>

			<h3>Roadmaps for studying</h3>
			<p>It helped me some time ago, so I am trying to find good roadmaps all-across the internet and sort it by categories. gleb.tk/roadmaps</p>
